# Airfare Analyzer
Many of the students here at IIT Kanpur live very far from their homes which makes going home by train both time consuming and tiring. Due to this these students prefer to travel to home via flights, but the complex dynamic pricing algorithms employed by the airlines make the task a bit tricky as it is very confusing to decide the best time to purchase the tickets. We begin our project with the aim to better understand the underlying trends and derive helpful insights. While working on project, we also realized the need for visualization of connectivity of domestic flights, which also we have tried to address via this effort.

- All four kinds of data samples are stored in the `data` directory
- The codes for the four phases are present in the `src` directory
